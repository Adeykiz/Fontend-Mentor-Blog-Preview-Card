## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project help me refresh my memory on some css properties that I've forgotten 😂. For example, importing and using fonts:
```
@font-face{
  font-family: "Figtree";
  src: url(Resources/assets/fonts/static/Figtree-ExtraBold.ttf);
  font-weight: 800;
  font-style: normal;
}
```

It also helped me learn how to adjust properties of elements in correlation to either the page's width/height; this way, eliminating the need for media queries


### Continued development

I'd like to continue/focus/refine the clamp(), min() and max() techniques for proper and more efficient use.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://www.chatgpt.com) - This helped me grasp the basic concept of clamp, min and max css properties
